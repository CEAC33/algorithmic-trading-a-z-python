- Automated Trading
  - Trades executed by computers not humans
  - High-Frequency Trading (HFT)
  - Complex strategies / algorithms
 

**Applications and Use Cases**

- Timing trades (long and short positions) to benefit from mispricing / market inefficiencies
- Independent from general market trends (works in bull and bear markets)
- Technical indicators (e.g. Moving Averages) and other Pattern Recognition Techniques (Machine Learning / AI) are used
